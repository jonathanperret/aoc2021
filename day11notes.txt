# Part 1

An hybrid of Life and the fish thing?

Day 9 sounds like a good template, with its input matrix.

By the way, the input is very small (10x10), which is worrying somehow
for part 2. Possibly this is expecting a hashlife implementation?

Do we need to add a border as we did on day 9? It may be useful to
avoid range checks at the edges of the matrix, but we'll need to make
sure not to flash those cells. On the other hand, since we won't be
processing them we can initialize them at 0 and be sure they'll never
flash.

Hmm, we may actually update the border cells during the flash phase.
But a border cell starting at 0 can never go above 5 during a single
flash phase, I think. So if we reset them to 0 in the reset phase,
we should be good.
