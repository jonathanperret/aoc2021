# Part 1

Ah, parenthesis matching.

The only challenge I can envision is my stack size, uxn has only 256 bytes available.

What's the size of the input? We have 110 lines, all around 110 characters long. This
should fit on the uxn stack if I don't do anything stupid.

A minor challenge will be to unwind the stack after an error. Pushing a marker at the
start should be enough.

Funnily enough, if the marker is 00, unwinding the stack is done in three bytes:

  LIT fd JCN
