# Part 1

I'm not even done reading the text but I notice already the coordinates in the input
are not 16-bit safe… *groan*.

Ah, but we're told to ignore cubes outside -50..50 — "for now"!

So we have 20 cubes in a 101x101 volume that we need to add or subtract.

After an excursion in JSCAD to visualize the result (a pretty dense blob, in fact)…

How many voxels are we talking about? More than a million, clearly I'm not fitting
that in memory, even at one bit per voxel I would need 128KB.

I can do like for day 5, process the input repeatedly over a single slice of the
volume, and add up the results.
