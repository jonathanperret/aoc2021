# Part 1

No parsing today, yeah!

Straightforward implementation butâ€¦ "That's not the right answer. Curiously,
it's the right answer for someone else; â€¦"

I check that I go the right input: yes.

On a whim, I just swap player starting positions, for the same message. Of course,
there are only 90 possible inputs so collisions are bound to occur a lot.

It does mean I have found the right result for at least two of these inputs.

Time for a Sheets implementation.

Which shows me that I made a dumb mistake while moving pawns: I applied an
extra "modulo 10" operation to the current position before adding the die sum.
Surprising that it still worked on the sample!

# Part 2

Wow, scary big numbers and parallel universes. This might
require a bit more thinking than part 1.

The leaderboard was filled in 20 minutes though, so that can't be impossible.

What's the longest game possible?

The die would have to always roll to a 1, of course. After one turn, a player's
score would be its starting position plus â€” wait, those 1-based positions are
annoying.

Noodling around in Sheets, I determine that if I move to 0-based positions
(i.e. 0..9 instead of 1..10), the score of a player after N turns is N less
than the score obtained with 1-based positions. In other words, a players's
score now increases by their position + 1 each turn.

Now, if the die always rolls 1 and a player starts at 0, their positions will go
1,2,3,4,5,6 and their score will go 2,5,9,14,20,27.

      pos  score
      0    0
      1    0+1+1 = 2
      2    2+2+1 = 5
      3    5+3+1 = 9
      4    14
      5    20
      6    27

That single-player game would end after the 6th turn.

In the same "1-only" universe, a player starting at 1 would go:

      pos  score
      1    0
      2    0+2+1 = 3
      3    3+3+1 = 7
      4    7+4+1 = 12
      5    12+5+1 = 18
      6    18+6+1 = 25

In fact, the score at turn N increases by:

  1 + (Sum of die rolls up to turn N + initial position) % 10

This isn't very helpful as it is. But the spreadsheet makes it very clear that
no game can last more than 6 turns. In fact, one "worst" game has the player
starting at 0-based position 9 and rolling only ones, so that they go:

      turn   pos  score
      0      9    0
      1      0    1
      2      1    3
      3      2    6
      4      3    10
      5      4    15
      6      5    21

More observations playing around with my spreadsheet that runs games for each
starting position given a series of die rolls:

  - the best score reachable after 1 turn is 10:
    - either start with 6 and roll 3,
    - or     start with 7 and roll 2,
    - or     start with 8 and roll 1.
  - the best score reachable after 2 turns is 19:
    - start with 7, roll 1, 1
    - start with 6, roll 2, 1
    - start with 5, roll 3, 1

Notice how the best score after one turn does not lead to the best score after
two turns.

So how many universes should be considered? If a player always reaches 21 after
at most 6 turns, there will be at most 11 rolls, I think. For example, if both
players play a "worst" game:

      turn  roll pos1 score1 pos2 score2
      0     1    9    0      7    0
      1     1    0    1
      2     2                9    10
      3     1    1    3
      4     1                0    11
      5     1    2    6
      6     1                1    13
      7     1    3    10
      8     1                2    16
      9     1    4    15
      10    1                3    20
      11    1    5    21

Here's a worrying thought: this doesn't add up to enough universes to reach the
large counts shown in the sample. 3 to the 11th power is only 177,147 !

"player 1 wins in 444356092776315 universes, while player 2 merely wins in
341960390180808 universes." : this adds up to a total of 786316482957123
universes. Which power of 3 is that?

3^31 is 617673396283947, which is below, and 3^32 is above that number.

It's not really suprising that the result is not exactly a power of three:
not all games will have the same length.

Still, I must have computed something wrongâ€¦

Ah yes, I forgot to roll the die three times! ðŸ¤¦

Does that make for longer games? Trying various scenarios in the spreadsheet,
it looks like there are still games than last 11 turns, for example:


      turn  rolls pos1 score1 pos2 score2
      0     3     8    0      8    0
      1     3     1    2
      2     3                 1    2
      3     3     4    7
      4     3                 4    7
      5     3     7    15
      6     3                 7    15
      7     3     0    16
      8     3                 0    16
      9     3     3    20
      10    3                 3    20
      11    3     6    27

But this game does 33 rolls, so it only one of 3^33 11-turn games.
Now we're in the expected ballpark.

We're not really closer to computing the count of universes where
each player wins, though.

The solution probably uses some kind of induction. For example, if
we knew the counts for a target score of 20, would it help finding
the counts for a score of 21? Doesn't look like it.

Here's an interesting observation though: when rolling the die
three times, it doesn't matter whether we roll 1,2,3 or 3,2,1 or
1,3,2. In fact, only the sum matters, and it ranges between 3 and 9
with varying counts of ways of reaching these sums:

      roll1   roll2   roll3   sum
      1       1       1       3
      1       1       2       4
      1       2       1       4
      2       1       1       4
      1       1       3       5
      1       2       2       5
      1       3       1       5
      2       1       2       5
      2       2       1       5
      3       1       1       5
      1       2       3       6
      1       3       2       6
      2       1       3       6
      2       2       2       6
      2       3       1       6
      3       1       2       6
      3       2       1       6
      1       3       3       7
      2       2       3       7
      2       3       2       7
      3       1       3       7
      3       2       2       7
      3       3       1       7
      2       3       3       8
      3       2       3       8
      3       3       2       8
      3       3       3       9

Here are the counts:

      sum     count
      3       1
      4       3
      5       6
      6       7
      7       6
      8       3
      9       1

So, there are 7 possible die sums. If we were to roll a 3-9 die
instead of three 1-3 dice, how long could a game get?

I have one where the player starts at 3 (0-based), the roll sums are
7,4,3,3,3,7,7 and the scores go 1,6,14,15,19,20,28. Adding a second
player doing the same thing, we end up with 13 turns before the
game is resolved.

At each turn, we pick one sum among 7. There are therefore 7^13=96,889,010,407
13-turn games played with a 3-9 die. Still a bit too large to simulate all
of those games.

How many possible states are there for a game though? Since both scores
start at 0 and must be below 21, there are only 21*21=441 possible states
any game can go through!

Hmm wait, the player positions are part of the game state too. If we include
them, we have 21*21*10*10 = 44100 possible game states, which looks still quite
reasonable.

I think the game states form a directed acyclic graph, where you can only go
from state (p1,p2,s1,s2) to (p1',p2',s1',s2') if:
  - p1 == p1' or p2 == p2';
  - and ((s1 == s1' and s2' > s2) or (s1' > s1 and s2' == s2)).

There are two extra nodes in the graph for the "player1 wins"/"player2 wins"
states, which nodes can reach instead of a node with a score >= 21.

So, starting from (5,7,0,0) (sample start positions), how many ways are there
to get to e.g. (8,7,3,0) ? Exactly one, because this requires three "1" rolls.

Assuming we can compute all the edges of that DAG, the count of player 1 wins
would be found starting from the "player 1 wins" node and summing all the
edges for every distinct path that goes back to the initial state.
