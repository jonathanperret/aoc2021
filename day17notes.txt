# Part 1

The input is extremely short:

  target area: x=192..251, y=-89..-59


OK, the first thing I notice is that X and Y are completely decorrelated:
we can compute the successive values of X for a given launch angle without
considering Y, and vice versa.

So for a given start X velocity, there is a range of time values (possibly
empty, possibly infinite on the right) where the probe is within the target X
range. And if Y is within range for any of those times, the probe hits the
target.

Vice versa, there is a range of time values (possibly empty, but always finite)
where the probe is within the Y range of the target, and if at any of these times
it is also within X range, etc.

Also, assuming the target is below the launch point, the requested result (the
maximum Y reached) is independent of the starting dX value. What is the shape
of the f(dY)=maxY curve?

  - if dY <= 0, maxY is obviously the first value of Y, i.e. 0;
  - if dY > 0, the successive Y values are dY, dy+(dY-1), dY+(dY-1)+(dY-2)…
    i.e. at time t>0, we have Y = t·dY - (0 + 1 + … + t-2)     [ edit: this should go up to t-1 ]
                                = t·dY - (t-2)(t-1)/2
                                = -t^2/2 + (dY + 3/2)·t - 1
    This parabola peaks when its derivative crosses zero. The derivative is
    given by:
                Y' = -t + dY + 3/2
    It reaches 0 at a likely non-integer value of t given by:

                t = dY + 3/2

    The time at which the peak is reached is therefore one of
                [ int(dY+3/2), int(dY+3/2) + 1 ]

    Plugging that back into the equation for Y, we get:
                Ymax = -(dY + 3/2)^2/2 + (dY + 3/2)^2 - 1
                     = (dY + 3/2)^2/2 - 1

This is a parabola again. We're not looking for a peak here though —
unsurprisingly, as long as we increase the initial Y velocity we can
increase the maximum height reached — but we need one of the steps to
end in the target area. High-school analytics isn't going to get us
there I'm afraid.

What about dX? As noted above, the range of time values where the probe
is within the target area for a given dX is unrelated to dY. We just
need both ranges to intersect.

So, we could first go through dX values — what is the useful range of dX?
  - since the target area is on the right of the origin, dX has to be
    positive as well.
  - if dX is larger than the right-side X of the target area, the first
    step will overshoot so we don't need to consider dX values larger
    than the end of the area (x=251 here).

For each dX between 1 and 251, we can compute the range of t values
where the probe is within the (xmin,ymin)-(xmax,ymax) area.

What is the useful range of dY values?
  - there are dY values at or below zero that can reach the target,
    but given that we are trying to maximize the height reached, I
    don't think any of those are useful to test;
  - there is an absolute minimum for dX below which xmin is never
    reached. What is the maximum X reached for a given dX?
    We have X = t·dX - (0 + 1 + … + t-2)
              = t·dX - (t-2)(t-1)/2
              = -t^2/2 + (dX + 3/2)·t - 1

    Oh. I only now realized the equations for X and Y are identical.
    [ edit: this is not true, vX never goes below 0.]

    Anyway, how large does dX need to be for X to reach xmin?

    This equation needs to have a (possibly non-integer) solution:

         xmin = -t^2/2 + (dX + 3/2)·t - 1
            0 = -t^2/2 + (dX + 3/2)·t - 1 - xmin

    We now that for this to have a solution, b^2-4ac needs to be >= 0,
    where a = -1, b = (dX + 3/2) and c = -1 - xmin.

            (dX + 3/2)^2 - 4·(-1)·(-1 - xmin) >= 0
            dX^2 + 3·dX + 9/4 - 4 - 4·xmin >= 0
            dX^2 + 3·dX - 7/4 - 4·xmin >= 0

    As expected, for dX = 0 we never reach the target area (assuming xmin > 0).

    I'm getting tired of 2nd-degree equations so I'll just use
    https://www.mathsisfun.com/quadratic-equation-solver.html
    for this one. For xmin=192, we have -7/4-4·(192) = -769.75, plugging
    that in gives us a root at dX ≈ 26.28.

    The sample has xmin=20, which gives dX ≈ 10.43. Ah, this is wrong since
    as shown in the text, dX=6 clearly reaches the target.

    Aah, I also missed a difference between the X and Y equations: dX never
    goes below zero! But this just means we should ignore the second root
    of the equation for X=xmin (the probe doesn't come back after crossing xmin).

    Found my error in the initial equation, it should be:

            X = t·dX - (0 + 1 + … + t-1)
              = t·dX - (t-1)(t)/2
              = -t^2/2 + (dX + 1/2)·t

    This is now the (simpler!) equation that needs a solution:

         xmin = -t^2/2 + (dX + 1/2)·t
            0 = -t^2/2 + (dX + 1/2)·t - xmin

    The discriminant that needs to be >=0 is now:

         (dX + 1/2)^2 - 4·(-1)·(-xmin) >= 0
         (dX + 1/2)^2 - 4·xmin >= 0
         dX^2 + dX + 1/4 - 4·xmin >= 0

    Plugging xmin=20 gives dX > 8 which is still wrong!

    Let's see, if dX=6 which works in the sample, we have

            X = -t^2/2 + (6 + 1/2)·t

    And this clearly crosses X=xmin for t=5.
    Argh, forgot a -1/2. Again:

         (dX + 1/2)^2 - 4·(-1/2)·(-xmin) >= 0
         (dX + 1/2)^2 - 2·xmin >= 0
         dX^2 + dX + 1/4 - 2·xmin >= 0

    With xmin=20 we get dX > 5.82 which is finally consistent with the sample.

    With xmin=192 we get dX > 19.

OK, so why was I looking at dY again? Ah right, to find a lower bound for dY.
If dX is so low that xmin is never reached, there's no point in looking for
dY. But having a lower bound for dX puts an upper bound on the number of steps
we can take and still be on the left of xmax. Or does it? Not really, since
the horizontal velocity always ends up being 0 at which point it does not
matter how many more steps we take. In fact, past that point X stops looking
like a parabola and is just a constant.

I'm not really getting anywhere with that, am I? Let's just brute-force it
a bit.

I'm not going to do any parsing today, I'll just plug the values in.

To convert these to hex:

  node -p '[20,30,-10,-5].map(x=>(x+0x10000).toString(16).slice(-4)).join(" ")'

That may be considered cheating. Oh, well.

Simulation was straightforward. And testing 1..255 for each of dx and dy proved
sufficient.

    hit dx=21 dy=0 yreached=0
    hit dx=22 dy=0 yreached=0
    hit dx=23 dy=0 yreached=0
    hit dx=24 dy=0 yreached=0
    hit dx=25 dy=0 yreached=0
    hit dx=26 dy=0 yreached=0
    hit dx=21 dy=1 yreached=1
    hit dx=22 dy=1 yreached=1
    hit dx=23 dy=1 yreached=1
    hit dx=24 dy=1 yreached=1
    hit dx=25 dy=1 yreached=1
    hit dx=20 dy=2 yreached=3
    hit dx=21 dy=2 yreached=3
    hit dx=22 dy=2 yreached=3
    hit dx=23 dy=2 yreached=3
    hit dx=24 dy=2 yreached=3
    hit dx=20 dy=3 yreached=6
    hit dx=21 dy=3 yreached=6
    hit dx=22 dy=3 yreached=6
    hit dx=23 dy=3 yreached=6
    hit dx=20 dy=4 yreached=10
    hit dx=21 dy=4 yreached=10
    hit dx=22 dy=4 yreached=10
    hit dx=20 dy=5 yreached=15
    hit dx=21 dy=5 yreached=15
    hit dx=22 dy=5 yreached=15
    hit dx=20 dy=6 yreached=21
    hit dx=21 dy=6 yreached=21
    hit dx=22 dy=6 yreached=21
    hit dx=20 dy=7 yreached=28
    hit dx=21 dy=7 yreached=28
    hit dx=20 dy=8 yreached=36
    hit dx=21 dy=8 yreached=36
    hit dx=20 dy=9 yreached=45
    hit dx=21 dy=9 yreached=45
    hit dx=20 dy=10 yreached=55
    hit dx=21 dy=10 yreached=55
    hit dx=20 dy=11 yreached=66
    hit dx=21 dy=11 yreached=66
    hit dx=20 dy=12 yreached=78
    hit dx=21 dy=12 yreached=78
    hit dx=20 dy=13 yreached=91
    hit dx=21 dy=13 yreached=91
    hit dx=20 dy=14 yreached=105
    …
    hit dx=20 dy=87 yreached=3828
    hit dx=21 dy=87 yreached=3828
    hit dx=20 dy=88 yreached=3916
    hit dx=21 dy=88 yreached=3916

As expected, all of the hits occurred with dx near 20 (between 20 and 26). And
once we reached dy=7, only dx=20 and dx=21 were hits. This makes sense, because
when launching the probe upwards we quickly reach a point where X velocity is
extinguished well before we hit the target area.

Anyway, on to part 2.

# Part 2

Hmm, is that just the count of lines from my part 1 output? No, at least because
negative dy values must now be considered.

That was not complicated. But by answer of 1126 is too low? Weird.

Ah of course, when doubling the size of the searched dy range to -255…255 I
figured that I could simultaneously reduce the dx range to 0…128 to keep
the iteration count constant. That was… misguided. Searching from 0 to 255
for dx, I now get 2986 hits.

And that's it.

Looking back, today's time spent analyzing the problem to death really wasn't
well spent.

# Some more observations.

When dy>0, does the probe always have a step where y=0? It looks like it, e.g.
if dy=3, y goes 0, 3, 5, 6, 6, 5, 3, 0, …

The equation for y is y = -t^2/2 + (dY + 1/2)·t. It is obviously zero at t=0,
and the next value of t that sets it to zero is :

          -t^2/2 + (dY + 1/2)·t = 0
          -t/2 + (dY + 1/2) = 0      { t>0 }
          t = 2·dY + 1

If dY is an integer, clearly this value of t will be one as well.

Knowing this, the problem of part 1, where we can safely assume that only positive
values of dY are intereting, can be reformulated a bit: given a positive dY, does
the probe hit the target area when starting at (X(2·dY+1), 0) with a velocity of
(vX(2·dY+1), vY(2·dY+1)) ?

What is the vertical velocity of the probe as it crosses the X axis? Intuitively
it is -dY, but let's prove it. The derivative of our y equation is:

          y' = -t + (dY + 1/2)

At t=2·dY+1, we get y' = -(2·dY+1) + (dY+1/2)
                       = -2·dY -1 + dY + 1/2
                       = -dY - 1/2 ???

My math is failing me. But this is ridiculous, clearly the vertical speed at
time t is dY-t since it starts at dY and decrements by 1 at each step.

At t=(2*dY+1), we therefore have vY=-dY-1, which checks out experimentally.
So it's not -dY after all.

So, starting upwards with some positive dY is basically the same (considering only Y) as
starting downwards with -(dY+1) as the initial vertical velocity.

And in part 1, we're obviously trying to maximize dY while still reaching the target.
Looking at the probe as it steps on the Y=0 line while going down, the fastest it can
go downwards and still hit some point in the target area is precisely ymin, the Y
coordinate of the area's bottom.

To have that speed at Y=0, we determined that it should start with an upwards velocity
that is one less than that, so we get dY = |ymin|-1 = ymin+1.

What about X? Well, X isn't an issue for the inputs we are given. If we start with
dY=|ymin|-1, we're going to be spending at least 2*(|ymin|-1) steps above the target area,
the time it takes for the Y velocity to descend to 0 and then down to -|ymin| at Y=0.

All we need to do is pick dX to be the smallest value that can get between xmin
and xmax. It will most likely end up in that range with vX=0 — I don't want to
go into proving this now, but intuitively, if the probe enters the xmin..xmax
range with some horizontal velocity left, it probably means that it could have
started with less initial horizontal velocity.

Anyway, all we need is for that minimal dX to get the probe into the target X range in
fewer steps than it takes for the probe to return from its excursion above the Y=0 line.

For my input where xmin=192, I computed above (by solving dX^2 + dX + 1/4 - 2·xmin >= 0)
that the minimal dX was 20.

With ymin=-89, it stands to reason that if we start upwards with dY=88, the horizontal
velocity will be extinguished (after dX=20 steps) well before the probe goes back
to Y=0. And from that 20th step on, the probe is above the target area and falling
like a rock without any horizontal movement.

In fact, for this not to hold, xmin would have to be big enough that the minimal dX
would be more than |ymin|. Here are solutions to the above equation for various values
of xmin:
            xmin=2000    dX=45
            xmin=4000    dX=63
            xmin=8000    dX=89
            xmin=10000   dX=100

So it looks like the target area would have to be way more to the right than it is
below the Y=0 line for our assumption not to hold. And on the contrary, the puzzle
inputs seem to have |ymin| and xmin in the same ballpark.

Anyway, we now know the best dY is ymin+1, so whats the highest Y reached on that
trajectory? It is simply the sum of ymin+1 down to 1, where the parabola peaks.

In other words, the answer to part 1 is simply (ymin+1)·ymin / 2.
