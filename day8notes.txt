# Part 1

Segment count

  1 : 2
  2 : 5
  3 : 5
  4 : 4
  5 : 5
  6 : 6
  7 : 3
  8 : 7
  9 : 6

Indeed, 1, 4, 7 and 8 are the unambiguous ones, using respectively
2, 4, 3 and 7 segments.

A minimal strategy for this part could be to:

   - repeat:
     - scan each line for '|';
     - count the number of non-whitespace characters;
     - increment counter;
     - if last whitespace was a newline, loop.
