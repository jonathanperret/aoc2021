# Part 1

Segment count

  1 : 2
  2 : 5
  3 : 5
  4 : 4
  5 : 5
  6 : 6
  7 : 3
  8 : 7
  9 : 6

Indeed, 1, 4, 7 and 8 are the unambiguous ones, using respectively
2, 4, 3 and 7 segments.

A minimal strategy for this part could be to:

   - repeat:
     - scan each line for '|';
     - count the number of non-whitespace characters;
     - increment counter;
     - if last whitespace was a newline, loop.

# Part 2

The easy digits in part 1 might be a misdirection.
Wouldn't it be easier to brute-force the segment assignments?

Let's see, we have 7 segments so we're looking for a 7-element
permutation. There are 7! of those, which comes out to 5880.

Would it work to try up to 5880 interpretations of each line?
We only have 200 lines to process, so that doesn't sound too bad.

Note that we only need to scan up to the '|' to find the right
assignment.

First, let's change the part 1 code to scan to the left of '|'
instead of the right.
